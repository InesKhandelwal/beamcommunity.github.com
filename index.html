<h3>Welcome to the BEAM Community</h3>

<p>The BEAM Community is a group of projects that run on the Erlang VM. Our goal is to host relevant projects in the Erlang community, making it easy for those projects to participate in the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013" target="_blank">Google Summer of Code 2013</a> and for interested students to pick their best choice.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Erlang VM</a> was originally designed by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, non-stop applications. Many companies around the world like Amazon, Heroku and Activision use the Erlang VM in their stack and open source projects like <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/" target="_blank">CouchDB</a> and <a href="http://basho.com/riak/" target="_blank">Riak</a> are built on top of it too.</p>

<span id="contact"></span>

<p>Our currently hosted projects include <a href="http://discoproject.org/" target="_blank">Disco</a>, a distributed computing framework originated from Nokia, <a href="http://zotonic.com/" target="_blank">Zotonic</a>, a high performance CMS in Erlang, <a href="http://www.ejabberd.im/" target="_blank">ejabberd</a>, a robust XMPP server used largely around the world and others (<a href="https://github.com/beamcommunity/beamcommunity.github.com/wiki" target="_blank">see the full list in our wiki</a>). This gives students a wide range of choices that goes from working on distributed systems, to maintaining robust servers and language design.</p>

<p>At the end of the summer, we hope students have learned and we have enabled them to do useful contributions to those projects. We hope they grow more and more interested on their related fields, becoming members of our vibrant community!</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>

<p>Feel free to reach us <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/beam-community" target="_blank">via the mailing list</a> or by joining <code>#beam-community</code> on irc.freenode.net.</p>

<h3>Instructions for mentors</h3>

<p>In case you maintain a project that runs on the Erlang VM and you would like to be part of the BEAM Community or a project that you contribute is already part of the BEAM community and you would like to help them mentor students, please contact us!</p>

<h3>Instructions for students</h3>

<p>At this moment, we are still submitting the BEAM Community as an organization to Google. The list of accepted organizations will <a href="https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2013" target="_blank">be published on 8th April</a>. Also check the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page" target="_blank">Google Summer of Code website for acceptance criteria</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, it is great that you are checking us out early! If you can't wait to contribute to some of our projects regardless, please let us know and we will help you get started!</p>
